# gutenparse

This project has a few parts, all of which are designed to help me curate the Labelled and Balanced Gutenberg Bookset (LabGub).

1. `gutenparse.py`

    A little library to parse some common metadata from RDF metadata files in Project Gutenberg books.

2. `remove_*.py` scripts

    Several scripts to prune books from a collection of Project Gutenberg books.
    For these to work, it is assumed that the book collection is structured like so:

    ```
    collection
    ├── 9043
    │   ├── pg9043.rdf
    │   └── pg9043.txt.utf8
    ├── 9044
    │   ├── pg9044.rdf
    │   └── pg9044.txt.utf8
    ├── 9045
    │   ├── pg9045.rdf
    │   └── pg9045.txt.utf8
    ├── 9046
    │   ├── pg9046.rdf
    │   └── pg9046.txt.utf8
    └── 9047
        ├── pg9047.rdf
        └── pg9047.txt.utf8
    ```

    They are used by passing the RDF files as command line arguments.
    The results are logged in detail.

    ```bash
    $ python remove_non_english.py collection/*/*.rdf

    ```

    _These scripts are destructive, and you are responsible for your own backups_.
    If you're scared, pass `--dry` as the _last_ parameter to do a dry run where nothing is actually deleted.

    ```bash
    $ python remove_multiple_authors.py collection/*/*.rdf --dry
    ```

3. `aggregate_stats.py`

    A final analysis script designed to log some aggregate stats and save a CSV containing labels for each book.


## TODO

- balance lcc subjects
  - _could_ get clever
    - parse out single letters. might not need to, or might be a bad idea. (currently doing this though)
    - remove specifics. (EX: E456)
  - might be best to just leave codes as-is and
    - remove under-represented
    - trim over-represented

- balance author birth years
  - don't need to get perfect uniform distribution over years
  - must truncate distribution tails
  - might need to trim over-represented decades

- subject and birth year might not be independent, so pruned distribution might be order dependent.  hopefully not much.

- license and headers

- perform prune and balance
  - make sure original is backed up safely
      - totally different directory
      - readonly permissions for all users
  - run each processor script
    1. write a sentence or two saying why this script now
    2. run script and pipe to log file `python do_shit.py previous_step/*/*.rdf > current_step_log.txt 2>&1 &`
    3. copy log down to local machine `scp lstm-server:data/big_drive/prunes/current_step_log.txt ./`
    4. rename mutated directory `mv previous_step current_step`
    5. back up processed dir with `tar -czf current_step.tar.gz current_step`
  - run analysis script

- actual progress
  - [X] english_only
  - [X] labelled_english_only
  - [ ] single_author_labelled_english_only, 2 running right now

# Story

Project priorities:
- Fully labelled
- Balanced
- Big

There are two steps to making this dataset: pruning and balancing.
Read on if you're interested in how they happened.

## Pruning

Any dataset pulled from the real world, when viewed through the lens of a particular project or goal, has plenty of missing labels and unnecessary or unexpected information.
This one is no stranger!
So let's start cleaning it up.
(One project's trash is another project's treasure, so if you want the dataset backup from any step in this process, shoot me an email.)

### Starting Point

I started off with a big ol' dump of books from Project Gutenberg's FTP endpoints.
It's just a big, flat directory with a directory for each book, and (hopefully) two files per book directory.
One RDF metadata file, and one UTF-8 file containing the actual book text.

```
txt_and_rdf/
    ├── 9043/
    │   ├── pg9043.rdf
    │   └── pg9043.txt.utf8
    ├── 9044/
    │   ├── pg9044.rdf
    │   └── pg9044.txt.utf8
    ├── 9045/
    │   ├── pg9045.rdf
    │   └── pg9045.txt.utf8
    ├── 9046/
    │   ├── pg9046.rdf
    │   └── pg9046.txt.utf8
    ├── 9047/
    |   ├── pg9047.rdf
    |   └── pg9047.txt.utf8
    ...
```

The first thing I did is remove all files except those RDF and UTF-8 files, then remove the empty directories, and then remove the directories with only one file.
Of course I didn't record how much data I was deleting in this process, or the bash pipe soup that actually did the magic, but the audit trail starts now!
This is now my starting point, with 39807 books totalling 15 gigabytes of text and metadata:

```
$ ls txt_and_rdf | wc -l
39807
```

```
$ du -hs txt_and_rdf
15G     txt_and_rdf
```

Now I'll prune and measure iteratively until I have a well-balanced dataset that's (hopefully) still pretty big.

### English Only

I would _like_ to make this dataset multilingual, but the overwhelming majority of books in the starting set are English.
So, in order to have a balanced representation of the most common languages, I'd need to remove almost all of the English books.
A core priority of this project is dataset size, so I'll just remove all books that aren't English.
Specifically, I'll remove any book where English does not appear as any of the languages.

```
$ python remove_non_english.py txt_and_rdf/*/*.rdf
Processing 39807 meta files...

Removing FR /home/ec2-user/data/big_drive/prunes/txt_and_rdf/10053
Removing LA /home/ec2-user/data/big_drive/prunes/txt_and_rdf/10054
Removing DE /home/ec2-user/data/big_drive/prunes/txt_and_rdf/10055
...

Non-English languages encountered during removal:
FR (1801)
FI (1561)
DE (992)
NL (648)
PT (520)
ES (405)
IT (308)
SV (130)
...

Removed 6577 books.
```

To see the omitted output of that command, see [this log file](english_only_log.txt).
You might notice ~6000 lines down that the script found a book with more than one title.
That's surprising, but whatever.
Data is just weird sometimes.
We'll have a look at what that is at the end if it's still hanging around after more pruning steps.

At the end of that pruning step, we lost 6577 books.
Let's back that directory up and measure it.

```
$ mv txt_and_rdf english_only                 # the directory is no longer best described as text and rdf
$ tar -czf english_only.tar.gz english_only   # compressing it in case we need it later is a good idea
$ chmod -w english_only.tar.gz                # let's remove write permissions so we don't wreck it
$ du -hs english_only
13G     english_only
$ ls english_only | wc -l
33230
```

We only lost 2 gigabytes and we still have tens of thousands of books.
Neat!

### No Unknowns

Next we'll remove any book that's missing metadata we're interested in.
It would be cool to exploit the unlabelled data with some unsupervised pretraining or something, but that's not what I have in mind for this dataset.
For now, let's just drop all the unlabelled data.

Specifically, books will be removed if they aren't labelled with a title, author, author birth year, language, or Library of Congress Classification.
(LCC, which is just a fancy acronym for subject.)
_Technically_, books with unknown languages are already gone from the previous step.
A smarter person might've done this in a different order, but onward and upward!

```
$ python remove_unknowns.py english_only/*/*.rdf
Processing 33230 meta files...

Removing /home/ec2-user/data/big_drive/prunes/english_only/10000 for:
['author']

Removing /home/ec2-user/data/big_drive/prunes/english_only/10001 for:
['author']

Removing /home/ec2-user/data/big_drive/prunes/english_only/1000 for:
['author', 'lcc']

...

Unknowns encountered during removal:
author (9049)
lcc (1838)
title (1)

Removed 9992 books.
```

Again, check out the omitted output in [the log file](labelled_english_only_log.txt).
Looks like our friend with more than one title made it passed the language pruning - he shows up around 28K lines down the log.

We lost 9992 books this time.
Let's back up and measure again.

```
$ mv english_only labelled_english_only
$ tar -czf labelled_english_only.tar.gz labelled_english_only
$ chmod -w labelled_english_only.tar.gz
$ du -hs labelled_english_only
9.0G    labelled_english_only
$ ls labelled_english_only | wc -l
23238
```

It might seem silly to throw away so much data because of missing author birth dates or LCC subjects, but pre-pruned datasets are being saved so feel free to request them and prune them to your own liking!
I think a fully labelled dataset with over twenty thousand books totalling gigabytes in size is still really cool!

### Single Authors

Now I'll purge any books that have more than one author.
I feel like I'm saying this a lot, but this might seem silly.
Why not keep those books around?
Especially considering many single author books in the dataset might be missing an author?

There are a couple of reasons.
First, the models I plan on training are simpler with single authors.
And given a book with two or more authors, I cannot bring myself to _choose_ which of the authors to keep.
Even if I remove statistical bias and choose randomly, it feels like a personal and academic affront to prefer one author to another.
Second, there's really only one reason and you already read it.
We probably won't lose that many books anyways.

```
$ python remove_multiple_authors.py labelled_english_only/*/*.rdf
Processing 23238 meta files...

Removing /home/ec2-user/data/big_drive/prunes/labelled_english_only/10008 for authors White, Stewart Edward -- Adams, Samuel Hopkins
Removing /home/ec2-user/data/big_drive/prunes/labelled_english_only/10042 for authors Smith, Henrietta Brown -- Murray, E. R. (Elsie Riach)
Removing /home/ec2-user/data/big_drive/prunes/labelled_english_only/10056 for authors Mencius -- Confucius
...

Removed 667 books.
```

Peek at [the log file](single_author_labelled_english_only.txt) if you wish.
You might notice an error message - "No handlers could be found for logger "rdflib.term".
I'm not _exactly_ sure where that's coming from, but we'll dig in later if it becomes a problem.
Also, notice that the book with multiple titles is gone now!

Some pretty heavy hitting authors got removed!
George Washington, William Shakespeare, Voltaire, David Hume, Karl Marx, John Quincy Adams, Charles Dickens, Theodore Roosevelt, Confucius...
Now I feel a bit of remorse for removing these books.
Hopefully those authors are represented in the books written by single authors, because it would be a shame for any model trained on this data to be devoid of their influence!

Oh well!
Let's back up and measure our last pruning step.

```
$ mv labelled_english_only single_author_labelled_english_only
$ tar -czf single_author_labelled_english_only.tar.gz single_author_labelled_english_only
$ chmod -r single_author_labelled_english_only.tar.gz
$ du -hs single_author_labelled_english_only
8.7G    single_author_labelled_english_only
$ ls single_author_labelled_english_only | wc -l
22571
```

Barely lost anything!
That's it for pruning, so let's name the directory appropriately.

```
$ mv single_author_labelled_english_only pruned
```

Now we'll move on to balancing.

## Balancing

Here I'll make sure the labels that I care about are represented evenly in the dataset.
The labels I care about are author birth year and LCC subject.
You'll see why I care about them in a future post, but for now, let's measure the labels in the unbalanced dataset we just made.

### Preliminary Measurement

TODO

```
$ python aggregate_stats.py single_author_labelled_english_only/*/*.rdf

TODO output
```

There are two files output at this stage.
First, the aggregate stats script gives a breakdown of each book's labels and some aggregate statistics in [its log](pruned_stats_log.txt).
Second, [a CSV file](pruned_stats.csv) is output so that we can do some easy analysis with nice tools.

TODO scp in the stats csv, aggregate stats.

lcc subject vs birth year.  correlation?

### Birth Year Balancing

TODO

if non correlated, maximize uniform distribution area by choice of cutoff years.  make rectangle big.

### LCC Subject Balancing

TODO

## Surgery By Hand

My code is imperfect, and so are my assumptions, so there are a couple of stragglers to hunt down.
We'll look close at these anomalies and understand why they threw me off.

TODO:
- multiple title book
- No handlers could be found for logger "rdflib.term"
